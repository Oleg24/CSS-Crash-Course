# Basic Layouts

## Basic Layout 1
This layout is here to demonstrate a very commonly used layout and how easy it is to setup with very basic CSS.

## Basic Layout 2
This layout is composed of just a top bar and content area, but it demonstrates responsiveness.  
If you resize the screen, the elements will resize with it.

### I highly encourage you to take these layouts and modify them and add your own CSS as practice.
