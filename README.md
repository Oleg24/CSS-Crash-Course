## CSS Preprocessors (ex: LESS & SASS)

### What is a CSS preprocessor?
[Wikipedia article on preprocessors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprocessor)

A CSS preprocessor is essentially a supercharged version of CSS that has more functionality
like mixins (functions), variables, nesting, and inheritance.

Imagine being able to change a single color variable and have your entire site
change almost instantly. Immediate color scheme change without having to go out
and change each and every place where you are using that specified color.

SASS and LESS are the two primary preprocessors, but there are many others.
Which one you choose is really up to your own preference.

If you want to see what I mean by that, I encourage you to go through these:
[LESS Features](http://lesscss.org/features/)  
[SASS Guide](http://sass-lang.com/guide)

### [LESS](lesscss.org) Workflow

## Using Design Frameworks
You always want to be able to follow the [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) principles.
So, why re-do CSS when you can utilize a framework and speed up your design process. Focus on the
nicer pieces of your website and what make it unique. Avoid spending time on the base
css that can be repeated and improved project after project.

There are three primary CSS design frameworks:  
[Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com) - Most Popular  
[Foundation](foundation.zurb.com)  
[Semantic-UI](semantic-ui.com) - Newer, but very nice
