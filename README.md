## CSS Preprocessors (ex: LESS & SASS)

### What is a CSS preprocessor?
[Wikipedia article on preprocessors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprocessor)

A CSS preprocessor is essentially a supercharged version of CSS that has more functionality
like mixins (functions), variables, nesting, and inheritance.

Imagine being able to change a single color variable and have your entire site
change almost instantly. Immediate color scheme change without having to go out
and change each and every place where you are using that specified color.

SASS and LESS are the two primary preprocessors, but there are many others.
Which one you choose is really up to your own preference.

If you want to see what I mean by that, I encourage you to go through these:

[SASS Guide](http://sass-lang.com/guide)
